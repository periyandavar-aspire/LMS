        <h1>Vision</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The University Libraries are engaged in learning and discovery as essential participants 
            in the educational community. We develop, organize, provide access to and preserve 
            materials to meet the needs of present and future generations of students and scholars. 
            We explore and implement innovative technologies and services to deliver information and 
            scholarly resources conveniently to users anytime/anyplace. We also provide well-equipped 
            and functional physical spaces where students can pursue independent learning and discovery 
            outside the classroom. The University Libraries support scholarship and research productivity 
            and foster their vitality.</p>
